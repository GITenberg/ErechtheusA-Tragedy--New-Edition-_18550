<span class="i0">Mother of life and death and all men's days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, whom I chief of all men born would bless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call thee with more loving lips than theirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, for of this very body of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And living blood I have my breath and live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold me, even thy son, me crowned of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me made thy child by that strong cunning God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fashions fire and iron, who begat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me for a sword and beacon-fire on thee,<br /></span><span class="linenum">10</span>
<span class="i0">Me fosterling of Pallas, in her shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reared, that I first might pay the nursing debt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hallowing her fame with flower of third-year feasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first bow down the bridled strength of steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose the wild wont of their birth, and bear<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or fourfold service of his fire-swift wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whirl the four-yoked chariot; me the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stand before thee naked now, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O holy and general mother of all men born,<br /></span><span class="linenum">20</span>
<span class="i0">But mother most and motherliest of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, for I ask thee rather of all the Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have we done? what word mistimed or work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath winged the wild feet of this timeless curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall as fire upon us? Lo, I stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on this brow's crown of the city's head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crowns its lovely body, till death's hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waste it; but now the dew of dawn and birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fresh upon it from thy womb, and we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold it born how beauteous; one day more<br /></span><span class="linenum">30</span>
<span class="i0">I see the world's wheel of the circling sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll up rejoicing to regard on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This one thing goodliest, fair as heaven or he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worth a God's gaze or strife of Gods; but now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would this day's ebb of their spent wave of strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep it to sea, wash it on wreck, and leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A costless thing contemned; and in our stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where these walls were and sounding streets of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make wide a waste for tongueless water-herds<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Nor thou to live and look on; for the womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare me not base that bare me miserable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear this loud brood of the Thracian foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break its broad strength of billowy-beating war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, and upon it as a blast of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blowing, the keen wrath of a fire-souled king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strange growth grafted on our natural soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A root of Thrace in Eleusinian earth<br /></span><span class="linenum">50</span>

<span class="i0">The music of his making, nor a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward hopes of ours auspicious; for the note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rings as for death oracular to thy sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That goes before him on the sea-wind blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of this charge laid on me, to put out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brief light kindled of mine own child's life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with this helmsman hand that steers the state<br /></span><span class="linenum">60</span>
<span class="i0">Run right on the under shoal and ridge of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The populous ship with all its fraughtage gone<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sails that were to take the wind of time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent, and the tackling that should hold out fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In confluent surge of loud calamities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken, with spars of rudders and lost oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were to row toward harbour and find rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some most glorious haven of all the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And else may never near it: such a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods have set his lips on fire withal<br /></span><span class="linenum">70</span>
<span class="i0">Who threatens now in all their names to bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruin; but none of these, thou knowest, have I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chid with my tongue or cursed at heart for grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing how the soul runs reinless on sheer death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose grief or joy takes part against the Gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what they will is more than our desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their desire is more than what we will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no man's will and no desire of man's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall stand as doth a God's will. Yet, O fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, that seest me how I cast no word<br /></span><span class="linenum">80</span>
<span class="i0">Against them, plead no reason, crave no cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boast me not blameless, nor beweep me wronged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this fair wreath of towers we have decked thee with,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This chaplet that we give thee woven of walls,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This girdle of gate and temple and citadel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn round beneath thy bosom, and fast linked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to thine heart's root&mdash;this dear crown of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This present light, this city&mdash;be not thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow to take heed nor slack to strengthen her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare we so short-lived howsoe'er, and pay<br /></span><span class="linenum">90</span>
<span class="i0">What price we may to ransom thee thy town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not me my life; but thou that diest not, thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all our house die for this people's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep thou for ours thy crown our city, guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give it life the lovelier that we died.<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
